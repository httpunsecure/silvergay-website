        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name's Cherry. I go by the handle SilverScript.<br>
            My pronouns are she/her.<br>
            I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Triangle">the urban part of Texas</a>, and <abbr title="Texas officially views Daylight Saving Time, and I don't know JavaScript, so I apologize for a non-exact time.">my timezone is America/Chicago</abbr>.</p>
        <p>I have some interest in <abbr title="Notably: Radiohead, Depeche Mode, Pendulum, and some others.">music</abbr>. I usually listen to entire albums instead of specific songs. I also tend to fixate on artists.</p>
        <p>I like to cook, though I'm not very adventurous in it (yet). I do want to learn how to make more advanced meals though, but right now I just make simple meals and I can definitely keep myself fed.</p>
        <p>I have a preference for Linux. At the time of writing, I'm waiting to get a Framework 16 (I hope) to put Linux on, but right now I use Linux on a HP prebuilt desktop and Windows on a Toshiba Tecra C50-C if I need compatibility.</p>
        <p>If you need to know something not listed here, you can ask me, but otherwise, <abbr title="If you know me, maybe suggest something?">I guess that's all.</abbr></p>
